TaxCI Changelog:
================
0.4.4
-----
fixes
- implemented handling of BCCluster-method "external" to TaxCIsummary
- fixed an error in transform_user_table()
- some minor issues in the man pages

0.4.3
-----
new functions
- parse_mPTP for parsing output of the species delimitation program mPTP
changes
- renamed most functions: periods in non-generic-S3-methods were deleted and subsequent character changed to uppercase
- added S3 print method for BCCluster (former bc.cluster)
- added class "BCCluster" for output of the BCCluster function (former bc.cluster)
- BCCluster (former bc.cluster): new option 'method' for choosing a user-supplied clustering (e.g. from mPTP)
fixes
- some minor changes in the example
- TaxCIplot (former PlotCI): error occured when info=NA which was the default; replaced by ""
- added missing plotParamTCI (former plot.param.tci) argument in plotParamBCC (former plot.param.bcc) manpage

0.4.2
-----
fixes
- "Rhyssemus germanus - Problem" splitted homogeneous clusters were not marked with penalty point 5 if the respective species occured in an heterogeneous cluster, too.
- renamed find.in.clusters to find.species.in.clusters
- new function find.in.clusters: same as above but really directly search in bc.cluster.result$clusters
- changed plot-legend point 3 to "Species in heterogeneous cluster and in more than one cluster" (analogously)
- added option 'cluster.nodes' to plot.param.bcc and alterd 'vis.clusters' from PlotCI. Nodes CAN now be searched along with plot.param.bcc and vis.clusters is takes Boolean values or a vector of node numbers which should be marked.
- Added documentation for Carabidae dataset
- invisibly return clusters in find.in.clusters-functions
- Added verbose option to find.in.clusters-functions

0.4.1
-----
fixes
- fixed match ration calculation in summarize.TaxCI; now: 2*perfect cluster / (no. morphospecies + no. clusters); perfect clusters are non-splitted homogeneous
changes
- PlotCI: added "alternative.tiplabels" - option (e.g. for use with mixedFontLabel{ape})
- PlotCI: added experimental option 'box.placement' for automatic placement of boxes and tip labels
- PlotCI: added option 'vis.clades' to switch clade-dots off
minor changes
- changed colors of boxes
- plot.param.tci, PlotCI: fixed 'taxa-not-in-tree' warning
- removed sp.col from PlotCI arguments; was unused
- changed number of tips per page calculation from 'ntips / npages' to 'as.integer(ntips / npages) + 1' (whole number plus 1)

0.4.0
-----
new functions
- no.morphospecies
- find.in.clusters
- summarize.TaxCI

minor changes
- PlotCI: added dots to common nodes of each cluster
- TaxCI-script: set timestamp decimals to 2 and corrected units
- added $cluster output of bcc.cluster also to plot.param.bcc result-list
